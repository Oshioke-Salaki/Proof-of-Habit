# 🔥 StarkIt

**StarkIt** is an onchain habit tracker built on **Starknet🚀**. It helps users build consistency through daily habit logging, visual streaks, and public accountability — all while embracing the transparency and permanence of blockchain.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Create Habits**  
  Start tracking any habit — workouts, reading, meditation, etc.

- 🔥 **Daily Logging**  
  Log your progress once per day to maintain your streak.

- 🌱 **Streak Building**  
  Stay consistent and grow your streaks — miss a day, and it resets.

- 🏆 **Leaderboard & Activity Feed**  
  Discover public habits with the highest streaks and see recent logs from users.

- 👤 **User Profiles**  
  Set your username and showcase your habits.

- 🖼️ **IPFS Image Support**  
  Add pictures to habits and logs — stored via IPFS.

- ⛓️ **Fully Onchain**  
  All core actions (habit creation, logging, usernames) are stored on Starknet.

## 💡 Motivation

Building better habits is hard. StarkIt brings accountability, ownership, and transparency to the process — all powered by decentralized infrastructure.

## 🧱 Built for Starknet

StarkIt was designed during a 100-hour builder sprint to showcase the power of Starknet for everyday apps. From storage-efficient Cairo contracts to modular frontend components, this project serves as a playful but powerful proof-of-concept.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Cairo** – Smart contracts
- **React + Next.js** – Frontend
- **starknet.js** – Starknet integration
- **Pinata + IPFS** – Decentralized media storage
- **TailwindCSS**
